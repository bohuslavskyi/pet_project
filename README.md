# Pet Project
## Overview
This project was created for educational purposes to explore and practice using: 
* [`Vite`](https://vitejs.dev/guide/): A fast, opinionated web dev build tool that serves your code via native ES Module imports.
* [`React.js:`](https://react.dev/): A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
* [`Redux`](https://redux.js.org/): A predictable state container for JavaScript applications.
* [`Ant Design`](https://ant.design/): A popular React UI library with a set of high-quality React components.
* [`React Router Dom v6`](https://reactrouter.com/en/main): Declarative routing for React.js.

The main goals were to understand Vite's project structure, experiment with React Router Dom v6 features, and implement state management with Redux Toolkit. Additionally, custom theming with Ant Design was explored, and a switcher based on the custom theme was implemented.
